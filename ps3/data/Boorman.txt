I am Arthur Frayn, and I am Zardoz. I have lived three hundred
years, and I long to die. But death is no longer possible. I am
immortal. I present now my story, full of mystery and intrigue -
rich in irony, and most satirical. It is set deep in a possible
future, so none of these events have yet occurred, but they *may.*
Be warned, lest you end as I. In this tale, I am a fake god by
occupation - and a magician, by inclination. Merlin is *my* hero!
I am the puppet master. I manipulate many of the characters and
events you will see. But *I* am invented, too, for your
entertainment - and amusement. And you, poor creatures, who
conjured *you* out of the clay? Is God in show business too?
